## Introduction
This is a list of published papers/open source codes/useful and interesting projects for **Depth Estimation and other related fields**.

The papers are categorized by paper types, number of cameras/views, camera type etc. The subjects include survey/review papers, depth/stereo based on different number of views(monocular, binocular and multiple), depth estiamtion for omnidirectional cameras, mainstream datasets and other related fields(camera calibration, depth fusion, depth completion).

The list of each subject can be found by clicking on the corresponding link below.
